  /**
   * Tests for TaxonomyReader's getParent() method. We check it by comparing its results to those we
   * could have gotten by looking at the category string paths (where the parentage is obvious).
   * Note that after testReaderBasic(), we already know we can trust the ordinal &lt;=&gt; category
   * conversions.
   *
   * <p>Note: At the moment, the parent methods in the reader are deprecated, but this does not mean
   * they should not be tested! Until they are removed (*if* they are removed), these tests should
   * remain to see that they still work correctly.
