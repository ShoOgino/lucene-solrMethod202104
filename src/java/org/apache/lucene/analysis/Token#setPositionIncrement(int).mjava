  /** Set the position increment.  This determines the position of this token
   * relative to the previous Token in a {@link TokenStream}, used in phrase
   * searching.
   *
   * <p>The default value is one.
   *
   * <p>Some common uses for this are:<ul>
   *
   * <li>Set it to zero to put multiple terms in the same position.  This is
   * useful if, e.g., a word has multiple stems.  Searches for phrases
   * including either stem will match.  In this case, all but the first stem's
   * increment should be set to zero: the increment of the first instance
   * should be one.  Repeating a token with an increment of zero can also be
   * used to boost the scores of matches on that token.
   *
   * <li>Set it to values greater than one to inhibit exact phrase matches.
   * If, for example, one does not want phrases to match across removed stop
   * words, then one could build a stop word filter that removes stop words and
   * also sets the increment to the number of stop words removed before each
   * non-stop word.  Then exact phrase queries will only match when the terms
   * occur with no intervening stop words.
   *
   * </ul>
   * @param positionIncrement the distance from the prior term
   * @see org.apache.lucene.index.TermPositions
