     * @param field The query field.
     * @param maxMultiTermExpansions The maximum number of expansions across all multi-terms and
     *     across all segments. It counts expansions for each segments individually, that allows
     *     optimizations per segment and unused expansions are credited to next segments. This is
     *     different from {@link MultiPhraseQuery} and {@link
     *     org.apache.lucene.search.spans.SpanMultiTermQueryWrapper} which have an expansion limit
     *     per multi-term.
     * @param segmentOptimizationEnabled Whether to enable the segment optimization which consists
     *     in ignoring a segment for further analysis as soon as a term is not present inside it.
     *     This optimizes the query execution performance but changes the scoring. The result
     *     ranking is preserved.
