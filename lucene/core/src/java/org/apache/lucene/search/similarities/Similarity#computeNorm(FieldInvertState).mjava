  /**
   * Computes the normalization value for a field, given the accumulated
   * state of term processing for this field (see {@link FieldInvertState}).
   *
   * <p>Matches in longer fields are less precise, so implementations of this
   * method usually set smaller values when <code>state.getLength()</code> is large,
   * and larger values when <code>state.getLength()</code> is small.
   *
   * <p>Note that for a given term-document frequency, greater unsigned norms
   * must produce scores that are lower or equal, ie. for two encoded norms
   * {@code n1} and {@code n2} so that
   * {@code Long.compareUnsigned(n1, n2) > 0} then
   * {@code SimScorer.score(freq, n1) <= SimScorer.score(freq, n2)}
   * for any legal {@code freq}.
   *
   * <p>{@code 0} is not a legal norm, so {@code 1} is the norm that produces
   * the highest scores.
   *
   * @lucene.experimental
