  /**
   * Expert: returns a readonly reader, covering all
   * committed as well as un-committed changes to the index.
   * This provides "near real-time" searching, in that
   * changes made during an IndexWriter session can be
   * quickly made available for searching without closing
   * the writer nor calling {@link #commit}.
   *
   * <p>Note that this is functionally equivalent to calling
   * {#flush} and then opening a new reader.  But the turnaround time of this
   * method should be faster since it avoids the potentially
   * costly {@link #commit}.</p>
   *
   * <p>You must close the {@link IndexReader} returned by
   * this method once you are done using it.</p>
   *
   * <p>It's <i>near</i> real-time because there is no hard
   * guarantee on how quickly you can get a new reader after
   * making changes with IndexWriter.  You'll have to
   * experiment in your situation to determine if it's
   * fast enough.  As this is a new and experimental
   * feature, please report back on your findings so we can
   * learn, improve and iterate.</p>
   *
   * <p>The resulting reader supports {@link
   * DirectoryReader#openIfChanged}, but that call will simply forward
   * back to this method (though this may change in the
   * future).</p>
   *
   * <p>The very first time this method is called, this
   * writer instance will make every effort to pool the
   * readers that it opens for doing merges, applying
   * deletes, etc.  This means additional resources (RAM,
   * file descriptors, CPU time) will be consumed.</p>
   *
   * <p>For lower latency on reopening a reader, you should
   * call {@link IndexWriterConfig#setMergedSegmentWarmer} to
   * pre-warm a newly merged segment before it's committed
   * to the index.  This is important for minimizing
   * index-to-search delay after a large merge.  </p>
   *
   * <p>If an addIndexes* call is running in another thread,
   * then this reader will only search those segments from
   * the foreign index that have been successfully copied
   * over, so far</p>.
   *
   * <p><b>NOTE</b>: Once the writer is closed, any
   * outstanding readers may continue to be used.  However,
   * if you attempt to reopen any of those readers, you'll
   * hit an {@link AlreadyClosedException}.</p>
   *
   * @lucene.experimental
   *
   * @return IndexReader that covers entire index plus all
   * changes made so far by this IndexWriter instance
   *
   * @throws IOException If there is a low-level I/O error
