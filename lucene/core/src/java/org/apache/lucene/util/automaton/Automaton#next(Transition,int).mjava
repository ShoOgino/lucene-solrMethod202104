   * Looks for the next transition that matches the provided label, assuming determinism.

   * iterating over multiple transitions from the same source state. It keeps the latest reached
   * transition index in {@code transition.transitionUpto} so the next call to this method can
   * continue from there instead of restarting from the first transition.
   *
   * @param transition The transition to start the lookup from (inclusive, using its {@link
   *     Transition#source} and {@link Transition#transitionUpto}). It is updated with the matched
   *     transition; or with {@link Transition#dest} = -1 if no match.
   * @param label The codepoint to look up.
   * @return The destination state; or -1 if no matching outgoing transition.
