   * Expert: increments the refCount of this IndexReader instance only if the IndexReader has not

   * already closed or is currently being closed. Either way this reader instance shouldn't be used
   * by an application unless <code>true</code> is returned.
   *
   * <p>RefCounts are used to determine when a reader can be closed safely, i.e. as soon as there
   * are no more references. Be sure to always call a corresponding {@link #decRef}, in a finally
   * clause; otherwise the reader may never be closed. Note that {@link #close} simply calls
   * decRef(), which means that the IndexReader will not really be closed until {@link #decRef} has
   * been called for all outstanding references.
