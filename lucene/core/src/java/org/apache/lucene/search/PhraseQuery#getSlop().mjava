  /**
   * Return the slop for this {@link PhraseQuery}.
   *
   * <p>The slop is an edit distance between respective positions of terms as defined in this {@link
   * PhraseQuery} and the positions of terms in a document.
   *
   * <p>For instance, when searching for {@code "quick fox"}, it is expected that the difference
   * between the positions of {@code fox} and {@code quick} is 1. So {@code "a quick brown fox"}
   * would be at an edit distance of 1 since the difference of the positions of {@code fox} and
   * {@code quick} is 2. Similarly, {@code "the fox is quick"} would be at an edit distance of 3
   * since the difference of the positions of {@code fox} and {@code quick} is -2. The slop defines
   * the maximum edit distance for a document to match.
   *
   * <p>More exact matches are scored higher than sloppier matches, thus search results are sorted
   * by exactness.
