  /**
   * Create an GeoCircle from a center, a radius and a desired accuracy. It is the most accurate
   * shape to represent a circle in non-spherical planets.
   *
   * <p>The accuracy of the circle is defined as the maximum linear distance between any point on
   * the surface circle and planes that describe the circle. Therefore, with planet model WSG84,
   * since the radius of earth is 6,371,000 meters, an accuracy of 1e-6 corresponds to 6.3 meters.
   * For an accuracy of 1.0 meters, the accuracy value would be 1.6e-7. The maximum accuracy
   * possible is 1e-12.
   *
   * <p>Note that this method may thrown an IllegalArgumentException if the circle being specified
   * cannot be represented by plane approximation given the planet model provided.
   *
   * @param planetModel is the planet model.
   * @param latitude is the center latitude.
   * @param longitude is the center longitude.
   * @param radius is the radius surface distance.
   * @param accuracy is the maximum linear distance between the circle approximation and the real
   *     circle, as computed using the Vincenty formula.
   * @return a GeoCircle corresponding to what was specified.
