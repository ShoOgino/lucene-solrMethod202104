  /**
   * Encodes a normalization factor for storage in an index.
   * <p>
   * The encoding uses a three-bit mantissa, a five-bit exponent, and the
   * zero-exponent point at 15, thus representing values from around 7x10^9 to
   * 2x10^-9 with about one significant decimal digit of accuracy. Zero is also
   * represented. Negative numbers are rounded up to zero. Values too large to
   * represent are rounded down to the largest representable value. Positive
   * values too small to represent are rounded up to the smallest positive
   * representable value.
