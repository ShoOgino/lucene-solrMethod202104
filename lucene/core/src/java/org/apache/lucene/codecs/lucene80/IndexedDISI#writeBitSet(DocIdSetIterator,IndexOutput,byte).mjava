  /**
   * Writes the docIDs from it to out, in logical blocks, one for each 65536 docIDs in monotonically
   * increasing gap-less order.
   * The caller must keep track of the number of jump-table entries (returned by this method) as well as the
   * denseRankPower and provide them when constructing an IndexedDISI for reading.
   * @param it  the document IDs.
   * @param out destination for the blocks.
   * @param denseRankPower for {@link Method#DENSE} blocks, a rank will be written every {@code 2^denseRankPower} docIDs.
   *                       Values &lt; 7 (every 128 docIDs) or &gt; 15 (every 32768 docIDs) disables DENSE rank.
   *                       Recommended values are 8-12: Every 256-4096 docIDs or 4-64 longs.
   *                       {@link #DEFAULT_DENSE_RANK_POWER} is 9: Every 512 docIDs.
   *                       This should be stored in meta and used when creating an instance of IndexedDISI.
   * @throws IOException if there was an error writing to out.
   * @return the number of jump-table entries following the blocks, -1 for no entries.
   *         This should be stored in meta and used when creating an instance of IndexedDISI.
