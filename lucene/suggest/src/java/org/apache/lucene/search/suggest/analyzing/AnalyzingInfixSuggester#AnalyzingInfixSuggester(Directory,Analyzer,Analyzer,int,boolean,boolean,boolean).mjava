   * Create a new instance, loading from a previously built AnalyzingInfixSuggester directory, if it

   * index). Note that {@link #close} will also close the provided directory.
   *
   * @param minPrefixChars Minimum number of leading characters before PrefixQuery is used (default
   *     4). Prefixes shorter than this are indexed as character ngrams (increasing index size but
   *     making lookups faster).
   * @param commitOnBuild Call commit after the index has finished building. This would persist the
   *     suggester index to disk and future instances of this suggester can use this pre-built
   *     dictionary.
   * @param allTermsRequired All terms in the suggest query must be matched.
   * @param highlight Highlight suggest query in suggestions.
