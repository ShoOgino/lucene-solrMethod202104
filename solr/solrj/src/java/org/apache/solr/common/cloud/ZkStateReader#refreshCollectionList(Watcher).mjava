   * Search for any lazy-loadable state format2 collections.

   * A stateFormat=1 collection which is not interesting to us can also
   * be put into the {@link #lazyCollectionStates} map here. But that is okay
   * because {@link #constructState(Set)} will give priority to collections in the
   * shared collection state over this map.
   * In fact this is a clever way to avoid doing a ZK exists check on
   * the /collections/collection_name/state.json znode
   * Such an exists check is done in {@link ClusterState#hasCollection(String)} and
   * {@link ClusterState#getCollectionsMap()} methods
   * have a safeguard against exposing wrong collection names to the users
