   * Get a comparator that determines the sort order of docs within a single Reader.

   * in-order. The default implementations allocate array[maxDoc] to hold native values for comparison,
   * but 1) they are transient (only alive while sorting this one segment) and 2) in the typical
   * index sorting case, they are only used to sort newly flushed segments, which will be smaller
   * than merged segments
   *
   * @param reader the Reader to sort
   * @param maxDoc the number of documents in the Reader
