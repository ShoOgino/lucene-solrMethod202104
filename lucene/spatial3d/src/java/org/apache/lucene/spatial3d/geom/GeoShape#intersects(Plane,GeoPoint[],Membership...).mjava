   * Assess whether a plane, within the provided bounds, intersects with the shape's edges. Any
   * overlap, even a single point, is considered to be an intersection. Note well that this method
   * is allowed to return "true" if there are internal edges of a composite shape which intersect
   * the plane. Doing this can cause getRelationship() for most GeoBBox shapes to return OVERLAPS
   * rather than the more correct CONTAINS, but that cannot be helped for some complex shapes that
   * are built out of overlapping parts.
   *
   * @param plane is the plane to assess for intersection with the shape's edges or bounding curves.
   * @param notablePoints represents the intersections of the plane with the supplied bounds. These
   *     are used to disambiguate when two planes are identical and it needs to be determined
   *     whether any points exist that fulfill all the bounds.
   * @param bounds are a set of bounds that define an area that an intersection must be within in
   *     order to qualify (provided by a GeoArea).
   * @return true if there's such an intersection, false if not.
