  /**
   * Merges all segments from an array of indexes into this
   * index.
   *
   * <p>This may be used to parallelize batch indexing.  A large document
   * collection can be broken into sub-collections.  Each sub-collection can be
   * indexed in parallel, on a different thread, process or machine.  The
   * complete index can then be created by merging sub-collection indexes
   * with this method.
   *
   * <p><b>NOTE:</b> the index in each Directory must not be
   * changed (opened by a writer) while this method is
   * running.  This method does not acquire a write lock in
   * each input Directory, so it is up to the caller to
   * enforce this.
   *
   * <p><b>NOTE:</b> while this is running, any attempts to
   * add or delete documents (with another thread) will be
   * paused until this method completes.
   *
   * <p>This method is transactional in how Exceptions are
   * handled: it does not commit a new segments_N file until
   * all indexes are added.  This means if an Exception
   * occurs (for example disk full), then either no indexes
   * will have been added or they all will have been.</p>
   *
   * <p>Note that this requires temporary free space in the
   * Directory up to 2X the sum of all input indexes
   * (including the starting index).  If readers/searchers
   * are open against the starting index, then temporary
   * free space required will be higher by the size of the
   * starting index (see {@link #optimize()} for details).
   * </p>
   *
   * <p>Once this completes, the final size of the index
   * will be less than the sum of all input index sizes
   * (including the starting index).  It could be quite a
   * bit smaller (if there were many pending deletes) or
   * just slightly smaller.</p>
   * 
   * <p>
   * This requires this index not be among those to be added.
   *
   * <p><b>NOTE</b>: if this method hits an OutOfMemoryError
   * you should immediately close the writer.  See <a
   * href="#OOME">above</a> for details.</p>
   *
   * @throws CorruptIndexException if the index is corrupt
   * @throws IOException if there is a low-level IO error
