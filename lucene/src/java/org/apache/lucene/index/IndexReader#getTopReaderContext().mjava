  /**
   * Expert: Returns a the root {@link ReaderContext} for this
   * {@link IndexReader}'s sub-reader tree. Iff this reader is composed of sub
   * readers ,ie. this reader being a composite reader, this method returns a
   * {@link CompositeReaderContext} holding the reader's direct children as well as a
   * view of the reader tree's atomic leaf contexts. All sub-
   * {@link ReaderContext} instances referenced from this readers top-level
   * context are private to this reader and are not shared with another context
   * tree. For example, IndexSearcher uses this API to drive searching by one
   * atomic leaf reader at a time. If this reader is not composed of child
   * readers, this method returns an {@link AtomicReaderContext}.
   * <p>
   * Note: Any of the sub-{@link CompositeReaderContext} instances reference from this
   * top-level context holds a <code>null</code> {@link CompositeReaderContext#leaves}
   * reference. Only the top-level context maintains the convenience leaf-view
   * for performance reasons.
   * <p>
   * NOTE: You should not try using sub-readers returned by this method to make
   * any changes (setNorm, deleteDocument, etc.). While this might succeed for
   * one composite reader (like MultiReader), it will most likely lead to index
   * corruption for other readers (like DirectoryReader obtained through
   * {@link #open}. Use the top-level context's reader directly.
