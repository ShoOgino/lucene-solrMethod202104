     * @param field                      The query field.
     * @param maxMultiTermExpansions     The maximum number of expansions across all multi-terms and across all segments.
     *                                   It counts expansions for each segments individually, that allows optimizations per
     *                                   segment and unused expansions are credited to next segments. This is different from
     *                                   {@link MultiPhraseQuery} and {@link org.apache.lucene.search.spans.SpanMultiTermQueryWrapper}
     *                                   which have an expansion limit per multi-term.
     * @param segmentOptimizationEnabled Whether to enable the segment optimization which consists in ignoring a segment
     *                                   for further analysis as soon as a term is not present inside it. This optimizes
     *                                   the query execution performance but changes the scoring. The result ranking is
     *                                   preserved.
