  /**
   * Create a priority queue that is pre-filled with sentinel objects, so that
   * the code which uses that queue can always assume it's full and only change
   * the top without attempting to insert any new object.<br>
   *
   * Those sentinel values should always compare worse than any non-sentinel
   * value (i.e., {@link #lessThan} should always favor the
   * non-sentinel values).<br>
   *
   * By default, the supplier returns null, which means the queue will not be
   * filled with sentinel values. Otherwise, the value returned will be used to
   * pre-populate the queue.<br>
   *
   * If this method is extended to return a non-null value, then the following
   * usage pattern is recommended:
   *
   * <pre class="prettyprint">
   * PriorityQueue&lt;MyObject&gt; pq = new MyQueue&lt;MyObject&gt;(numHits);
   * // save the 'top' element, which is guaranteed to not be null.
   * MyObject pqTop = pq.top();
   * &lt;...&gt;
   * // now in order to add a new element, which is 'better' than top (after
   * // you've verified it is better), it is as simple as:
   * pqTop.change().
   * pqTop = pq.updateTop();
   * </pre>
   *
   * <b>NOTE:</b> the given supplier will be called {@code maxSize} times,
   * relying on a new object to be returned and will not check if it's null again.
   * Therefore you should ensure any call to this method creates a new instance and
   * behaves consistently, e.g., it cannot return null if it previously returned
   * non-null and all returned instances must {@link #lessThan compare equal}.
