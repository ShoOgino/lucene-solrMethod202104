  /**
   * Expert: Returns the root {@link IndexReaderContext} for this {@link IndexReader}'s sub-reader
   * tree.
   *
   * <p>Iff this reader is composed of sub readers, i.e. this reader being a composite reader, this
   * method returns a {@link CompositeReaderContext} holding the reader's direct children as well as
   * a view of the reader tree's atomic leaf contexts. All sub- {@link IndexReaderContext} instances
   * referenced from this readers top-level context are private to this reader and are not shared
   * with another context tree. For example, IndexSearcher uses this API to drive searching by one
   * atomic leaf reader at a time. If this reader is not composed of child readers, this method
   * returns an {@link LeafReaderContext}.
   *
   * <p>Note: Any of the sub-{@link CompositeReaderContext} instances referenced from this top-level
   * context do not support {@link CompositeReaderContext#leaves()}. Only the top-level context
   * maintains the convenience leaf-view for performance reasons.
