  /**
   * @param targetNumBlockLines Target number of lines per block. Must be strictly greater than 0.
   *     The parameters can be pre-validated with {@link
   *     UniformSplitTermsWriter#validateSettings(int, int)}. There is one term per block line, with
   *     its corresponding details ({@link org.apache.lucene.index.TermState}).
   * @param deltaNumLines Maximum allowed delta variation of the number of lines per block. Must be
   *     greater than or equal to 0 and strictly less than {@code targetNumBlockLines}. The block
   *     size will be {@code targetNumBlockLines}+-{@code deltaNumLines}. The block size must always
   *     be less than or equal to {@link UniformSplitTermsWriter#MAX_NUM_BLOCK_LINES}.
   * @param blockEncoder Optional block encoder, may be null if none. If present, it is used to
   *     encode all terms blocks, as well as the FST dictionary and the fields metadata.
   * @param blockDecoder Optional block decoder, may be null if none. If present, it is used to
   *     decode all terms blocks, as well as the FST dictionary and the fields metadata.
   * @param dictionaryOnHeap Whether to force loading the terms dictionary on-heap. By default it is
   *     kept off-heap without impact on performance. If block encoding/decoding is used, then the
   *     dictionary is always loaded on-heap whatever this parameter value is.
