  /**
   * Adds a new {@link BlockLine} term for the current field.
   *
   * <p>This method determines whether the new term is part of the current block, or if it is part
   * of the next block. In the latter case, a new block is started (including one or more of the
   * lastly added lines), the current block is written to the block file, and the current block key
   * is added to the {@link org.apache.lucene.codecs.uniformsplit.IndexDictionary.Builder}.
   *
   * @param term The block line term. The {@link BytesRef} instance is used directly, the caller is
   *     responsible to make a deep copy if needed. This is required because we keep a list of block
   *     lines until we decide to write the current block, and each line must have a different term
   *     instance.
   * @param termStates Block line details for all fields in the line.
   * @param dictionaryBuilder to which the block keys are added.
