   * Builds an extension field string from a given extension key and the default query field. The

   * extension key is appended to the end of the returned string while the field is added to the
   * beginning. Special Query characters are escaped in the result.
   *
   * <p>Note: {@link Extensions} subclasses must maintain the contract between {@link
   * #buildExtensionField(String)} and {@link #splitExtensionField(String, String)} where the latter
   * inverts the former.
