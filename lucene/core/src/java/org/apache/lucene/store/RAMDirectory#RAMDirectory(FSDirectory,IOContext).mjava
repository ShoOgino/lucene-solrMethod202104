  /**
   * Creates a new <code>RAMDirectory</code> instance from a different
   * <code>Directory</code> implementation.  This can be used to load
   * a disk-based index into memory.
   * 
   * <p><b>Warning:</b> This class is not intended to work with huge
   * indexes. Everything beyond several hundred megabytes will waste
   * resources (GC cycles), because it uses an internal buffer size
   * of 1024 bytes, producing millions of {@code byte[1024]} arrays.
   * This class is optimized for small memory-resident indexes.
   * It also has bad concurrency on multithreaded environments.
   * 
   * <p>For disk-based indexes it is recommended to use
   * {@link MMapDirectory}, which is a high-performance directory
   * implementation working directly on the file system cache of the
   * operating system, so copying data to Java heap space is not useful.
   * 
   * <p>Note that the resulting <code>RAMDirectory</code> instance is fully
   * independent from the original <code>Directory</code> (it is a
   * complete copy).  Any subsequent changes to the
   * original <code>Directory</code> will not be visible in the
   * <code>RAMDirectory</code> instance.
   *
   * @param dir a <code>Directory</code> value
   * @exception IOException if an error occurs
