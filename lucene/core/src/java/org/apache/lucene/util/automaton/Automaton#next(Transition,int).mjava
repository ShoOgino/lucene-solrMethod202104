   * the latest reached transition index in {@code transition.transitionUpto} so

   * from the first transition.
   *

   *                   {@link Transition#source} and {@link Transition#transitionUpto}).

   *                   or with {@link Transition#dest} = -1 if no match.
   * @param label      The codepoint to look up.
   * @return The destination state; or -1 if no matching outgoing transition.
