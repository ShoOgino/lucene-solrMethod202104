  /**
   * Set the number of cache misses before an attempt is made to read the entire taxonomy into the
   * in-memory cache.
   *
   * <p>This taxonomy writer holds an in-memory cache of recently seen categories to speed up
   * operation. On each cache-miss, the on-disk index needs to be consulted. When an existing
   * taxonomy is opened, a lot of slow disk reads like that are needed until the cache is filled, so
   * it is more efficient to read the entire taxonomy into memory at once. We do this complete read
   * after a certain number (defined by this method) of cache misses.
   *
   * <p>If the number is set to {@code 0}, the entire taxonomy is read into the cache on first use,
   * without fetching individual categories first.
   *
   * <p>NOTE: it is assumed that this method is called immediately after the taxonomy writer has
   * been created.
