   * @param writer The IndexWriter to open from
   * @param applyAllDeletes If true, all buffered deletes will be applied (made visible) in the
   *     returned reader. If false, the deletes are not applied but remain buffered (in IndexWriter)
   *     so that they will be applied in the future. Applying deletes can be costly, so if your app
   *     can tolerate deleted documents being returned you might gain some performance by passing
   *     false.
   * @param writeAllDeletes If true, new deletes will be written down to index files instead of
   *     carried over from writer to reader directly in heap
