   * The policy may choose to delete some of the commit points, doing so by calling method {@link
   * IndexCommit#delete delete()} of {@link IndexCommit}.
   *

   * careful not to delete it, unless you know for sure what you are doing, and unless you can
   * afford to lose the index content while doing that.
   *
   * @param commits List of current {@link IndexCommit point-in-time commits}, sorted by age (the
   *     0th one is the oldest commit). Note that for a new index this method is invoked with an
   *     empty list.
