   *
   * @param minPrefixChars Minimum number of leading characters before PrefixQuery is used (default
   *     4). Prefixes shorter than this are indexed as character ngrams (increasing index size but
   *     making lookups faster).
   * @param commitOnBuild Call commit after the index has finished building. This would persist the
   *     suggester index to disk and future instances of this suggester can use this pre-built
   *     dictionary.
