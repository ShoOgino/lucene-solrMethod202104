  /**
   * Score a candidate doc for all slop-valid position-combinations (matches) 
   * encountered while traversing/hopping the PhrasePositions.
   * <br> The score contribution of a match depends on the distance: 
   * <br> - highest score for distance=0 (exact match).
   * <br> - score gets lower as distance gets higher.
   * <br>Example: for query "a b"~2, a document "x a b a y" can be scored twice: 
   * once for "a b" (distance=0), and once for "b a" (distance=2).
   * <br>Possibly not all valid combinations are encountered, because for efficiency  
   * we always propagate the least PhrasePosition. This allows to base on 
   * PriorityQueue and move forward faster. 
   * As result, for example, document "a b c b a"
   * would score differently for queries "a b c"~4 and "c b a"~4, although 
   * they really are equivalent. 
   * Similarly, for doc "a b c b a f g", query "c b"~2 
   * would get same score as "g f"~2, although "c b"~2 could be matched twice.
   * We may want to fix this in the future (currently not, for performance reasons).
