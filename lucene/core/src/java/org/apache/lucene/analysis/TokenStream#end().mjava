   * This method is called by the consumer after the last token has been consumed, after {@link
   * #incrementToken()} returned <code>false</code> (using the new <code>TokenStream</code> API).
   * Streams implementing the old API should upgrade to use this feature.
   *
   * <p>This method can be used to perform any end-of-stream operations, such as setting the final
   * offset of a stream. The final offset of a stream might differ from the offset of the last token
   * eg in case one or more whitespaces followed after the last token, but a WhitespaceTokenizer was
   * used.
   *
   * <p>Additionally any skipped positions (such as those removed by a stopfilter) can be applied to
   * the position increment, or any adjustment of other attributes where the end-of-stream value may
   * be important.
   *
   * <p>If you override this method, always call {@code super.end()}.
   *
   * @throws IOException If an I/O error occurs
