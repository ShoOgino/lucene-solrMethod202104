   *
   * <p>This is often a horribly costly operation; rarely is it warranted.
   *
   * <p>To see how many deletions you have pending in your index, call {@link

   *
   * <p><b>NOTE</b>: this method first flushes a new segment (if there are indexed documents), and
   * applies all buffered deletes.
