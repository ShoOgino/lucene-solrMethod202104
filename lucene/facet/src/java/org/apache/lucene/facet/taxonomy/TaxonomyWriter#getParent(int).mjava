  /**
   * getParent() returns the ordinal of the parent category of the category with the given ordinal.
   *
   * <p>When a category is specified as a path name, finding the path of its parent is as trivial as
   * dropping the last component of the path. getParent() is functionally equivalent to calling
   * getPath() on the given ordinal, dropping the last component of the path, and then calling
   * getOrdinal() to get an ordinal back.
   *
   * <p>If the given ordinal is the ROOT_ORDINAL, an INVALID_ORDINAL is returned. If the given
   * ordinal is a top-level category, the ROOT_ORDINAL is returned. If an invalid ordinal is given
   * (negative or beyond the last available ordinal), an IndexOutOfBoundsException is thrown.
   * However, it is expected that getParent will only be called for ordinals which are already known
   * to be in the taxonomy. TODO (Facet): instead of a getParent(ordinal) method, consider having a
   *
   * <p>getCategory(categorypath, prefixlen) which is similar to addCategory except it doesn't add
   * new categories; This method can be used to get the ordinals of all prefixes of the given
   * category, and it can use exactly the same code and cache used by addCategory() so it means less
   * code.
