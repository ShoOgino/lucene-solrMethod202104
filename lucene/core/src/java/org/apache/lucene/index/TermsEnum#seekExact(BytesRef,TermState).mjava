   * <p>Seeking by {@link TermState} should only be used iff the state was obtained from the same
   * {@link TermsEnum} instance.
   *
   * <p>NOTE: Using this method with an incompatible {@link TermState} might leave this {@link
   * TermsEnum} in undefined state. On a segment level {@link TermState} instances are compatible
   * only iff the source and the target {@link TermsEnum} operate on the same field. If operating on
   * segment level, TermState instances must not be used across segments.
   *
   * <p>NOTE: A seek by {@link TermState} might not restore the {@link AttributeSource}'s state.
   * {@link AttributeSource} states must be maintained separately if this method is used.
