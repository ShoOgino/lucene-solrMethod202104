         textContent concated (Attr's can have a single child which
         is either Text node or an EntityReference).  In practice,
         DOM implementations do not seem to use child nodes of
         Attributes, storing the "text" directly as the nodeValue.
         Fortunately, the DOM Spec indicates that when Attr.nodeValue
         is read, it should return the nodeValue from the child Node,
         so this approach should work both for strict implementations,
         and implementations actually encountered.
