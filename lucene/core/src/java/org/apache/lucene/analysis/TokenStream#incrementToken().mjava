   * Consumers (i.e., {@link IndexWriter}) use this method to advance the stream to the next token.
   * Implementing classes must implement this method and update the appropriate {@link
   * AttributeImpl}s with the attributes of the next token.
   *
   * <p>The producer must make no assumptions about the attributes after the method has been
   * returned: the caller may arbitrarily change it. If the producer needs to preserve the state for
   * subsequent calls, it can use {@link #captureState} to create a copy of the current attribute
   * state.
   *
   * <p>This method is called for every token of a document, so an efficient implementation is
   * crucial for good performance. To avoid calls to {@link #addAttribute(Class)} and {@link
   * #getAttribute(Class)}, references to all {@link AttributeImpl}s that this stream uses should be
   * retrieved during instantiation.
   *
   * <p>To ensure that filters and consumers know which attributes are available, the attributes
   * must be added during instantiation. Filters and consumers are not required to check for
   * availability of attributes in {@link #incrementToken()}.
   *
   * @return false for end of stream; true otherwise
