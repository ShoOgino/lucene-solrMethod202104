  /**
   * Sets the {@link PayloadProcessorProvider} to use when merging payloads.
   * Note that the given <code>pcp</code> will be invoked for every segment that
   * is merged, not only external ones that are given through
   * {@link #addIndexes}. If you want only the payloads of the external segments
   * to be processed, you can return <code>null</code> whenever a
   * {@link DirPayloadProcessor} is requested for the {@link Directory} of the
   * {@link IndexWriter}.
   * <p>
   * The default is <code>null</code> which means payloads are processed
   * normally (copied) during segment merges. You can also unset it by passing
   * <code>null</code>.
   * <p>
   * <b>NOTE:</b> the set {@link PayloadProcessorProvider} will be in effect
   * immediately, potentially for already running merges too. If you want to be
   * sure it is used for further operations only, such as {@link #addIndexes} or
   * {@link #optimize}, you can call {@link #waitForMerges()} before.
