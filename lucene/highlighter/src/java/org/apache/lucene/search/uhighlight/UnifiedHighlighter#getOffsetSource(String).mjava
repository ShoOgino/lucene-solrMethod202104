  /**
   * Determine the offset source for the specified field. The default algorithm is as follows:
   *
   * <ol>
   *   <li>This calls {@link #getFieldInfo(String)}. Note this returns null if there is no searcher
   *       or if the field isn't found there.
   *   <li>If there's a field info it has {@link
   *       IndexOptions#DOCS_AND_FREQS_AND_POSITIONS_AND_OFFSETS} then {@link OffsetSource#POSTINGS}
   *       is returned.
   *   <li>If there's a field info and {@link FieldInfo#hasVectors()} then {@link
   *       OffsetSource#TERM_VECTORS} is returned (note we can't check here if the TV has offsets;
   *       if there isn't then an exception will get thrown down the line).
   *   <li>Fall-back: {@link OffsetSource#ANALYSIS} is returned.
   * </ol>
   *
   * <p>Note that the highlighter sometimes switches to something else based on the query, such as
   * if you have {@link OffsetSource#POSTINGS_WITH_TERM_VECTORS} but in fact don't need term
   * vectors.
