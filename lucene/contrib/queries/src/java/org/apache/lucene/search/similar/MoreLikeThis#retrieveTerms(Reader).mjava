     * Find words for a more-like-this query former.
	 * The result is a priority queue of arrays with one entry for <b>every word</b> in the document.
	 * Each array has 6 elements.
	 * The elements are:
	 * <ol>
	 * <li> The word (String)
	 * <li> The top field that this word comes from (String)
	 * <li> The score for this word (Float)
	 * <li> The IDF value (Float)
	 * <li> The frequency of this word in the index (Integer)
	 * <li> The frequency of this word in the source document (Integer)	 	 
	 * </ol>
	 * This is a somewhat "advanced" routine, and in general only the 1st entry in the array is of interest.
	 * This method is exposed so that you can identify the "interesting words" in a document.
	 * For an easier method to call see {@link #retrieveInterestingTerms retrieveInterestingTerms()}.

	 * @return the most interesting words in the document ordered by score, with the highest scoring, or best entry, first
