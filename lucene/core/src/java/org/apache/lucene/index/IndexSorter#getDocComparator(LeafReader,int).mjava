   * Get a comparator that determines the sort order of docs within a single Reader.

   * <p>NB We cannot simply use the {@link FieldComparator} API because it requires docIDs to be
   * sent in-order. The default implementations allocate array[maxDoc] to hold native values for
   * comparison, but 1) they are transient (only alive while sorting this one segment) and 2) in the
   * typical index sorting case, they are only used to sort newly flushed segments, which will be
   * smaller than merged segments
   *
   * @param reader the Reader to sort
   * @param maxDoc the number of documents in the Reader
