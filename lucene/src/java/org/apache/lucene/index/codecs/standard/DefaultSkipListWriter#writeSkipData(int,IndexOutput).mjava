    // So we use the same length encoding that we use for the posting lists for the skip data as well:
    // Case 1: current field does not store payloads
    //           SkipDatum                 --> DocSkip, FreqSkip, ProxSkip
    //           DocSkip,FreqSkip,ProxSkip --> VInt
    //           DocSkip records the document number before every SkipInterval th  document in TermFreqs. 
    //           Document numbers are represented as differences from the previous value in the sequence.
    // Case 2: current field stores payloads
    //           SkipDatum                 --> DocSkip, PayloadLength?, FreqSkip,ProxSkip
    //           DocSkip,FreqSkip,ProxSkip --> VInt
    //           PayloadLength             --> VInt    
    //         In this case DocSkip/2 is the difference between
    //         the current and the previous value. If DocSkip
    //         is odd, then a PayloadLength encoded as VInt follows,
    //         if DocSkip is even, then it is assumed that the
    //         current payload length equals the length at the previous
    //         skip point
