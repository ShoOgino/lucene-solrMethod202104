  /**
   * <p>Similarity returns a number that is 1.0f or less (including negative numbers)
   * based on how similar the Term is compared to a target term.  It returns
   * exactly 0.0f when
   * <pre>
   *    editDistance &lt; maximumEditDistance</pre>
   * Otherwise it returns:
   * <pre>
   *    1 - (editDistance / length)</pre>
   * where length is the length of the shortest term (text or target) including a
   * prefix that are identical and editDistance is the Levenshtein distance for
   * the two words.</p>
   *
   * <p>Embedded within this algorithm is a fail-fast Levenshtein distance
   * algorithm.  The fail-fast algorithm differs from the standard Levenshtein
   * distance algorithm in that it is aborted if it is discovered that the
   * minimum distance between the words is greater than some threshold.
   *
   * <p>To calculate the maximum distance threshold we use the following formula:
   * <pre>
   *     (1 - minimumSimilarity) * length</pre>
   * where length is the shortest term including any prefix that is not part of the
   * similarity comparison.  This formula was derived by solving for what maximum value
   * of distance returns false for the following statements:
   * <pre>
   *   similarity = 1 - ((float)distance / (float) (prefixLength + Math.min(textlen, targetlen)));
   *   return (similarity > minimumSimilarity);</pre>
   * where distance is the Levenshtein distance for the two words.
   * </p>
   * <p>Levenshtein distance (also known as edit distance) is a measure of similarity
   * between two strings where the distance is measured as the number of character
   * deletions, insertions or substitutions required to transform one string to
   * the other string.
   * @param target the target word or phrase
   * @return the similarity,  0.0 or less indicates that it matches less than the required
   * threshold and 1.0 indicates that the text and target are identical
