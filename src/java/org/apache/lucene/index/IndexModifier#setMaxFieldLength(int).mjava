   * index terms that occur further in the document.  If you know your source
   * documents are large, be sure to set this value high enough to accommodate
   * the expected size.  If you set it to Integer.MAX_VALUE, then the only limit
   * is your memory, but you should anticipate an OutOfMemoryError.<p/>
   * By default, no more than 10,000 terms will be indexed for a field.
