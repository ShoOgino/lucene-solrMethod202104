  /** Creates an FSDirectory instance, trying to pick the
   *  best implementation given the current environment.
   *  The directory returned uses the {@link NativeFSLockFactory}.
   *  The directory is created at the named location if it does not yet exist.
   * 
   * <p>{@code FSDirectory} resolves the given Path when calling this method to a canonical /
   * real path to ensure it can correctly lock the index directory and no other process
   * can interfere with changing possible symlinks to the index directory inbetween.
   * If you want to use symlinks and change them dynamically, close all
   * {@code IndexWriters} and create a new {@code FSDirectory} instance.
   *
   *  <p>Currently this returns {@link MMapDirectory} for Linux, MacOSX, Solaris,
   *  and Windows 64-bit JREs, and {@link NIOFSDirectory} for other JREs.
   *  It is highly recommended that you consult the implementation's documentation
   *  for your platform before using this method.
   *
   * <p><b>NOTE</b>: this method may suddenly change which
   * implementation is returned from release to release, in
   * the event that higher performance defaults become
   * possible; if the precise implementation is important to
   * your application, please instantiate it directly,
   * instead. For optimal performance you should consider using
   * {@link MMapDirectory} on 64 bit JVMs.
   *
   * <p>See <a href="#subclasses">above</a> */
