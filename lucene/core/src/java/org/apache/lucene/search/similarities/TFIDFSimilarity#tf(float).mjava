   * Computes a score factor based on a term or phrase's frequency in a document. This value is

   * implementations of this method usually return larger values when <code>freq</code> is large,
   * and smaller values when <code>freq</code> is small.

   * @param freq the frequency of a term within a document
   * @return a score factor based on a term's within-document frequency
