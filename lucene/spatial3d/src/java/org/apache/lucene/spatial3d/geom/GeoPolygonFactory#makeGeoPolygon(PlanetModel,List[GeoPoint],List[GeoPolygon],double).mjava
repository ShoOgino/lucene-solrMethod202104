  /** Create a GeoPolygon using the specified points and holes, using order to determine 
   * siding of the polygon.  Much like ESRI, this method uses clockwise to indicate the space
   * on the same side of the shape as being inside, and counter-clockwise to indicate the
   * space on the opposite side as being inside.
   * @param pointList is a list of the GeoPoints to build an arbitrary polygon out of.  If points go
   *  clockwise from a given pole, then that pole should be within the polygon.  If points go
   *  counter-clockwise, then that pole should be outside the polygon.
   * @param holes is a list of polygons representing "holes" in the outside polygon.  Null == none.
   * @param leniencyValue is the maximum distance (in units) that a point can be from the plane and still be considered as
   *  belonging to the plane.  Any value greater than zero may cause some of the provided points that are in fact outside
   *  the strict definition of co-planarity, but are within this distance, to be discarded for the purposes of creating a
   *  "safe" polygon.
   * @return a GeoPolygon corresponding to what was specified, or null if a valid polygon cannot be generated
   *  from this input.
