   * Compute the shape's <em>delta</em> distance given a point. This is defined as the distance that

   * point. For some shapes, e.g. paths, this makes perfect sense. For other shapes, e.g. circles,
   * the "length" of the shape is zero, and the delta is computed as the distance from the center to
   * the point and back. A return value of Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY should be returned for points
   * outside of the shape.
   *
   * @param distanceStyle is the distance style.
   * @param x is the point's unit x coordinate (using U.S. convention).
   * @param y is the point's unit y coordinate (using U.S. convention).
   * @param z is the point's unit z coordinate (using U.S. convention).
   * @return the distance.
