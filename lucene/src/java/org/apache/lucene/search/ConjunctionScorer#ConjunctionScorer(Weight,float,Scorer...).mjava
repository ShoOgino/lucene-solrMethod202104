    // doNext() here advances all the first scorers to 5 (or a larger doc ID
    // they all agree on). 
    // However, if we re-sort before doNext() is called, the order will be 5, 3,
    // 2, 1, 5 and then doNext() will stop immediately, since the first scorer's
    // docs equals the last one. So the invariant that after calling doNext() 
    // all scorers are on the same doc ID is broken.

    // to be skipped on), but reverse all of the others so that
    // they will be skipped on in order of original high skip.
