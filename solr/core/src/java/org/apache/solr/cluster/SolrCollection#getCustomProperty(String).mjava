     * <p>Returns the value of a custom property name set on the {@link SolrCollection} or {@code null} when no such

     * <p>Using custom properties in conjunction with ad hoc {@link PlacementPlugin} code allows customizing placement
     * decisions per collection.
     *
     * <p>For example if a collection is to be placed only on nodes using SSD storage and not rotating disks, it can be
     * identified as such using some custom property (collection property could for example be called "driveType" and have
     * value "ssd" in that case), and the placement plugin (implementing {@link PlacementPlugin}) would then
     * {@link AttributeFetcher#requestNodeSystemProperty(String)} for that property from all nodes and only place replicas
     * of this collection on {@link Node}'s for which
     * {@link AttributeValues#getDiskType(Node)} is non empty and equal to {@link org.apache.solr.cluster.placement.AttributeFetcher.DiskHardwareType#SSD}.
