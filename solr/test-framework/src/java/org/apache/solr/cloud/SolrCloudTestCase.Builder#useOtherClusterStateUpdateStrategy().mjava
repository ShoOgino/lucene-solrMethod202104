     * This method makes the MiniSolrCloudCluster use the "other" cluster state update strategy than it normally would.

     * seed will exercise both code lines (distributed updates and Overseer based updates) so regressions can be spotted
     * faster.<p>
     *
     * The real need is for a few tests covering reasonable use cases to call this method. If you're adding a new test,
     * you don't have to call it (but it's ok if you do).
