  /**
   * Tests for TaxonomyWriter's getParent() method. We check it by comparing its results to those we
   * could have gotten by looking at the category string paths using a TaxonomyReader (where the
   * parentage is obvious). Note that after testReaderBasic(), we already know we can trust the
   * ordinal &lt;=&gt; category conversions from TaxonomyReader.
   *
   * <p>The difference between testWriterParent1 and testWriterParent2 is that the former closes the
   * taxonomy writer before reopening it, while the latter does not.
   *
   * <p>This test code is virtually identical to that of testReaderParent().
