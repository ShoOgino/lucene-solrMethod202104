  /**
   * Command-line interface to check and exorcise corrupt segments from an index.
   *
   * <p>Run it like this:
   *
   * <pre>
   * java -ea:org.apache.lucene... org.apache.lucene.index.CheckIndex pathToIndex [-exorcise] [-verbose] [-segment X] [-segment Y]
   * </pre>
   *
   * <ul>
   *   <li><code>-exorcise</code>: actually write a new segments_N file, removing any problematic
   *       segments. *LOSES DATA*
   *   <li><code>-segment X</code>: only check the specified segment(s). This can be specified
   *       multiple times, to check more than one segment: <code>-segment _2 * -segment _a</code>.
   *       You can't use this with the -exorcise option.
   * </ul>
   *
   * <p><b>WARNING</b>: <code>-exorcise</code> should only be used on an emergency basis as it will
   * cause documents (perhaps many) to be permanently removed from the index. Always make a backup
   * copy of your index before running this! Do not run this tool on an index that is actively being
   * written to. You have been warned!
   *
   * <p>Run without -exorcise, this tool will open the index, report version information and report
   * any exceptions it hits and what action it would take if -exorcise were specified. With
   * -exorcise, this tool will remove any segments that have issues and write a new segments_N file.
   * This means all documents contained in the affected segments will be removed.
   *
   * <p>This tool exits with exit code 1 if the index cannot be opened or has any corruption, else
   * 0.
