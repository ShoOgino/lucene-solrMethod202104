   * Create a GeoPolygon using the specified points and holes, using order to determine siding of

   * of the shape as being inside, and counter-clockwise to indicate the space on the opposite side
   * as being inside.
   *
   * @param description describes the polygon and its associated holes. If points go clockwise from
   *     a given pole, then that pole should be within the polygon. If points go counter-clockwise,
   *     then that pole should be outside the polygon.
   * @return a GeoPolygon corresponding to what was specified, or null if a valid polygon cannot be
   *     generated from this input.
